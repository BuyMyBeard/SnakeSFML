# SnakeSFML

This is something I felt like doing in an afternoon. completed it in 4 hours and less than 200 lines of code.
It uses SFML to render in a window the different assets I quickly made in Asesprite.
It was surprisingly simple to make, involving integers that indicates the lifetime left for each segment of the snake body.
